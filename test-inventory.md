# Inventory — End-to-End Test Guide (from an empty system)

A single **sequential** walkthrough for the tester. You start with **nothing** — no
warehouse, no store, no catalogue — and build it up in order. Each step says **who**
does it, **what to do**, and **what to expect**. The `(CH-n)` tags map a step to the
inventory-v2 change it exercises; you can ignore them while testing.

Everything here is done in the **admin panel**. The **admin changes don't change the
customer / picker / delivery apps**, so there's nothing to check in those apps *for this
guide*. (The apps' own inventory-v2 items — order decoding stays safe, and the
store-switch cart now resets cleanly — are a separate, minimal checklist in
`client-followups.md`; only the **customer app** has any real change.)

> **Picker app** changes (scan-gate, OOS reasons, in-app scanner + torch, scan-anything,
> undo a pick, partial pick, urgency timer) have their **own** end-to-end guide:
> **`test-picking.md`** — run that on the Android picker app. To exercise it a store needs
> **picking enabled**: top store-switcher → the store → sidebar **Settings → App/Store
> Config → "Picker Workflow" → "Enable picking" → Save Store Settings**.

**Golden rule of stock movement:** store stock only changes on a **Stock-In/Adjust**,
on a **transfer Receive**, or on a **sale**. Creating or dispatching a transfer does
**not** change store stock — only **Receive** does.

## 0. Prerequisites (read once)

1. **Backend** = branch `feat/inventory-v2` (haper-backend), **deployed + migrated and
   live on dev (`dapi.haper.in`)** — this now includes the late **CH-1**
   (`enabledForStore`) and **CH-7** (serving-warehouse enforcement) additions **and** the
   B-series + warehouse-cockpit endpoints. The admin app's `VITE_API_URL` must point at it.
   - (If a brand-new behaviour below seems to "do nothing", the dev box may just be a build
     behind — pull / redeploy latest `feat/inventory-v2`.)
2. **Admin** = haper-admin on `dev` with **PR #67** (inventory-v2 admin) **and PR #68**
   (`feat/inventory-v2-admin-gaps`) merged — the **batch-tracking toggle (B1)**, warehouse
   **write-off**, **reorder policy**, **push-transfer**, and the whole **§15 warehouse
   cockpit** are on PR #68. Pull / run / deploy it, then log in.
3. **Log in as a SUPER ADMIN.** You'll create everything else (warehouse, store,
   store admin, catalogue) from here. A few steps are repeated as a **store admin**
   to check the per-store views.
4. The **top store-switcher** sets the active store. **"All Stores"** (super admin
   only) is the cross-store view some reports use.

> **Batch tracking (now self-serve — B1):** the warehouse/store *batch* features (real
> dated lots, recall tracing, FEFO, per-lot cost/expiry) fully light up once **batch
> tracking is ON**. A **super admin** now flips this **from the UI** — no ops/DB step:
> - **Warehouse form** (Warehouses → New/Edit) → **"Batch tracking (FEFO + per-lot
>   cost/expiry)"** checkbox.
> - **Store edit modal** (Stores → Edit) → **"Batch tracking …"** checkbox.
>
> **Enabling seeds existing stock automatically**, so it's safe to turn on at any time
> (the first sale/dispatch won't fail). The batch **fields and columns are visible
> regardless**; with tracking **off**, stock behaves as one combined "legacy" lot.
> Turn it **on** for your test warehouse + store to see real per-batch behaviour.

# The sequential walkthrough

## 1. Create a warehouse  *(super admin)*

Stores can't be created without a warehouse (CH-7), so build this first.

1. Sidebar → **Warehouses** → **+ New warehouse**.
2. Name (e.g. `Patna WH`), **Region** = `Bihar`, optional code/address.
3. Save.

✅ Appears in the left list; clicking it shows an empty stock panel.
❌ A second warehouse with the **same name** → red "already exists" error.

### 1b. (Optional) Create a warehouse staff account — to test role separation
Sidebar → **Warehouse Staff** → **+ New staff** → pick role (Warehouse Manager =
full warehouse control; Warehouse Staff = receive + transfers) + the warehouse +
name/email/password. Log in as them later → they see only the warehouse screens.

✅ **Change password (super admin):** on the staff row → **Change password** → enter a new
   one (min 6) → **Update password**. Log in as that manager/staff with the **new** password
   → works; the **old** password no longer works. (The password is stored hashed, never shown.)
✅ **Suggest / Copy:** under any password field (warehouse staff, **store admin**, **delivery
   boy** — create *and* reset) there's a **🎲 Suggest** button that fills a strong password
   (alphanumeric + `.@#-_`, ambiguous chars like l/1/O/0 avoided) and reveals it, plus a
   **📋 Copy** button that copies it to the clipboard so you can hand it over. Suggested
   passwords always satisfy the min-6 rule.
❌ A password shorter than 6 chars → blocked (FE toast + backend **400**).
❌ A **store admin** (or anyone not super admin) has no Warehouse Staff page and the API
   rejects the change with **403** — only super admin manages these accounts.

### 1c. (Recommended) Turn on batch tracking — to exercise FEFO / lots / recall  (B1)  *(super admin)*
While editing the warehouse (or on create), tick **"Batch tracking (FEFO + per-lot
cost/expiry)"** → Save. ✅ Enabling **seeds existing stock**, so the response notes how
many lots were seeded and it's safe to flip at any time. Do the same on the **Store edit
modal** later (step 5/8) so store sales are FEFO too. With this **off**, the batch steps
below still work but everything is one combined "legacy" lot.

---

## 2. Create a supplier  *(super admin)*

Sidebar → **Suppliers** → **+ New supplier** → name (e.g. `ACME Distributors`),
optional contact/GSTIN → Save. ✅ Appears in the list.

---

## 3. Receive goods into the warehouse — with a batch no.  *(super admin)*  (CH-3)

This puts stock into the warehouse.

1. Sidebar → **Warehouses** → select the warehouse → **+ Receive goods**.
2. (Optional) supplier + invoice number.
3. **Add a product** — use the **"Add a product (search the catalog by name or barcode)"**
   box. Type e.g. `Peanut Butter` (or a barcode) → pick the product from the dropdown.
   This **auto-fills** the line's **SKU/Barcode** (= that product's barcode) and **Name**,
   so the warehouse SKU always matches a real item (the SKU **is** the barcode in Haper —
   the same value the picker scan-gate and transfers use). You then fill only:
   - **Batch no.** (type the supplier's printed lot, e.g. `LOT-A`, **or leave blank to
     auto-generate** — see the auto-batch rule below), **Cost / unit (₹) — required, > 0**,
     **Expiry**, **Qty** (e.g. `100`).
   - *Uncatalogued goods:* you can still **type** SKU/Barcode + Name manually in the grid.
4. **Receive**.

✅ Searching a product by **name or barcode** returns matches; picking one fills
   **SKU/Barcode + Name** for you. The same product served to several stores appears
   **once** (deduped by barcode).
✅ Warehouse stock shows the picked barcode … `Available 100` (SKU column = the barcode).
✅ The stock row also carries the product **thumbnail** (`image` in the API response),
   matched from the catalogue on **barcode = SKU**. A warehouse-only SKU that no catalogue
   item carries (uncatalogued goods typed by hand) shows `image: null` — never an error.
❌ Try to pick a product that has **no barcode enrolled** → toast "… has no barcode/SKU
   yet — enroll one on the item first" and **no line is added** (matches the transfer rule).
✅ Pick the **same product twice** → toast "… is already on the list" (no duplicate line).
❌ Leave **Cost / unit** blank (or `0`) on any line → **blocked** with "Enter a cost /
   unit (₹) greater than 0 for every line" (FE toast; backend also rejects with **400**).
   Cost is mandatory because it becomes the store's cost price (weighted-average) the
   moment the lot is transferred (CH-3).
✅ Receive the **same SKU + same batch no.** again (e.g. 50) → quantity becomes **150**
   (merged into the lot, no duplicate).

**Auto-batch when the "Batch no." is left blank** (batch-tracking warehouses only — with
the flag OFF there are no batches at all). The lot is named by **shelf-life** so FEFO and
cost stay truthful instead of everything piling into one shared `LEGACY` bucket:
   - **With an Expiry** → the lot is named **`AUTO-EXP-<expiry YYYYMMDD>`**
     (e.g. expiry 01-Sep-2026 → `AUTO-EXP-20260901`).
   - **No Expiry** → named **`AUTO-RCV-<today YYYYMMDD>`** (IST receive date).
✅ Receive the **same SKU, blank batch, same expiry** twice (e.g. 100 then 80) → they
   **merge** into one `AUTO-EXP-…` lot (qty **180**, cost = weighted-average).
✅ Receive the **same SKU, blank batch, a DIFFERENT expiry** → a **separate** `AUTO-EXP-…`
   lot (each expiry keeps its own cost + FEFO position; nothing is flattened).
✅ The auto code appears in the **stock detail modal → Batches (lots)**, the **Batch
   Recall** trace, and the `PURCHASE_IN` **Stock Ledger** row (not a blank / `LEGACY`).
❌ (Old, now fixed) blank batch no. used to dump every no-batch receipt into a single
   `LEGACY` lot — flattening all expiries and blending all costs. It no longer does.
✅ Stock table columns: **Available / Reserved / In-transit / Free-to-promise** (CH-4)
   — at this point Reserved = In-transit = 0, Free-to-promise = Available. Hover the
   **Cost/unit** header → "weighted average of open lots"; **Expiry** → "earliest open
   lot" (CH-3).
✅ Sidebar → **Stock Ledger** → a `PURCHASE_IN` row with a **Batch** column.
✅ **Near-expiry / expired** rows are **colour-flagged** in the stock table (B5).
✅ An **Export CSV** button (top of the stock panel) downloads the current (filtered)
   stock for a stock-take / audit (#13).
✅ Click any stock row → a **detail modal**: facts + **Batches (lots) · soonest-expiry
   first** (B5 — shown when batch tracking is on) + **write-off / adjust** + **reorder
   policy** + movement history (full detail in §15c–§15d).

### 3a. Bill-entry helpers (2026-08-03) — dedupe, verify, prefill, autosave

Six additions to **+ Receive goods** that speed up copying a paper/screen supplier bill
into the modal and stop double-entry:

- **MRP column** — a new optional column between **Cost / piece** and **Expiry**. Fill
  it in from the printed MRP on the bill for a visible cross-check; it's stored on the
  `PURCHASE_IN` ledger row (`mrp` field) and returned by the two lookup endpoints below.
- **Draft autosave (per-warehouse)** — the modal writes `invoiceNumber`, `supplierId` and
  every line to `localStorage` (500 ms debounce, keyed to the warehouse). Re-open the
  modal → a blue "You have an unsent draft from *X* ago — **Restore** / **Discard**"
  banner appears if the saved draft has real content. Cleared on successful **Receive**
  or an explicit **Discard**; a browser crash mid-entry no longer loses 100 lines.
- **Invoice lookup panel** — pick a supplier **and** type the invoice number → after
  ~400 ms the modal calls `GET /admin/procurement/receive/lookup?invoiceNumber=&supplierId=`.
  If a receipt with that key already exists, a yellow warning card appears above the
  grid: *"Invoice X from *supplier* was already received on *date* — N item(s). If this
  is a duplicate entry, don't submit."* with **Show items entered** to expand a
  read-only SKU / Batch / Qty / MRP table. **Use this to verify** each row on the paper
  bill was already captured (or spot a wrong one), before touching the item grid.
- **Repeat last from supplier** — button visible only while the grid is untouched
  (single blank row) and a supplier is chosen. Calls `GET /admin/procurement/receive/last`
  and pre-fills SKU / Name / Batch / Cost / Expiry / MRP for every line of the supplier's
  last receipt; **quantity is left blank** so the clerk enters fresh numbers. Toast:
  *"Prefilled N line(s) from *supplier*'s last receipt (*invoice*, *date*). Fill in
  quantities."*
- **Bill preview pane** — attach the bill (image or PDF) → the modal splits into a
  form on the left and a live preview on the right (image via a temporary object URL,
  PDF via `<embed>`, revoked on close). Read from the on-screen bill, not the paper.
- **Past-expiry HARD BLOCK** — a line with `Expiry < today` no longer opens a JS
  `confirm()`; **Receive** now shows a red toast and refuses to submit until the line
  is fixed or removed.

**Backend dedupe / lookup / last-receipt endpoints** (new, gated on `WAREHOUSE.RECEIVE_GOODS`):

- `POST /admin/procurement/receive` — now returns **HTTP 409** with
  `{ error, data: { existingReceivedAt, rowCount } }` when the same
  `warehouseId + supplierId + invoiceNumber` combo already has a `PURCHASE_IN` row.
  Skipped when `invoiceNumber` is blank OR `supplierId` is null (an invoice without a
  supplier has no unique key). The UI's lookup panel prevents most 409s; the backend
  guard is the safety net.
- `GET /admin/procurement/receive/lookup?invoiceNumber=&supplierId=` — returns
  `{ exists, receipts: [{ receivedAt, supplierId, supplierName, invoiceNumber, billUrl,
  lines: [{ sku, batchNo, quantityDelta, mrp, note }] }] }`. Rows are grouped by
  `refLabel + supplierId + createdAt` within a 5-second window (one receive-call =
  one receipt). `invoiceNumber` is required (400 otherwise), `supplierId` optional.
- `GET /admin/procurement/receive/last?supplierId=` — most recent receipt for that
  supplier in this warehouse. `{ found, receipt: { …, lines: [{ sku, name, batchNo,
  quantityDelta, mrp, costPrice, expiresAt }] } | null }`. Cost/expiry are joined from
  `warehouse_batches` (fall back to `null` on legacy/non-batch warehouses); name from
  `warehouse_stocks`.

**Regression checks:**

✅ Receive `INV-100 / ACME` once (2 lines) → **Receive goods** succeeds → re-open modal,
   pick **ACME**, type `INV-100` → yellow warning card appears with **2 items**;
   expanding shows the two SKU / batch / qty / MRP rows entered.
✅ Try to submit the same invoice again → toast *"Invoice INV-100 from this supplier was
   already received on <date>. Use the lookup to verify."* — nothing is written.
✅ Same `INV-100` from a **different supplier** → succeeds (different unique key).
✅ Same `INV-100` with **supplier = None** → succeeds (no unique key, dedupe skipped).
✅ Type into the modal, hit browser refresh → re-open → blue draft banner offers
   **Restore** (fills the fields) or **Discard** (clears localStorage).
✅ **Repeat last from supplier** appears only on an untouched grid → prefills sku /
   name / batch / cost / expiry / mrp with **Qty column blank**.
✅ Attach a bill (JPG or PDF) → preview pane renders on the right; close the modal → no
   `blob:` URL left in DevTools → **Memory**.
✅ A line with **Expiry = yesterday** → **Receive** shows red toast *"N line(s) have an
   expiry date in the past. Fix or remove them before receiving."* and does not submit.

**Backend tests:** `packages/admin/__tests__/procurement-receive-lookup.test.js` — 8
tests covering dedupe 409, different-supplier ok, blank-invoice skip, lookup grouping +
mrp, lookup `exists:false`, lookup 400 on missing invoice, last with joined cost/expiry,
last `found:false`.

#### Invoice numbers: case/space-proof matching + stored in CAPS (fix, 2026-08-09)

**The bug it fixes (seen in real production data):** bill `TS6826` was received (18
lines). Days later a clerk went to add a missed 19th line to the SAME bill but typed
`ts6826` in lowercase. Mongo compares strings case-sensitively, so the duplicate check
found **zero** matching rows — no "already received" warning, and the system quietly
created a **second, disconnected** bill record instead of pointing at the original. The
same thing happened when a clerk **pasted** a number and brought stray spaces with it
(`"  TS6826  "`).

Two things changed, in two steps:

1. **Matching** (`POST /receive` duplicate guard + `GET /receive/lookup`) ignores
   upper/lower case **and** leading/trailing spaces, while still matching the **whole**
   number — `TS6826` does **not** match `TS6826-A`.
2. **Storage** (final step, this change): the invoice number a clerk types on
   **Receive Goods** is now saved **trimmed and in CAPS**. Type `ts6826`, paste
   `  ts6826  `, or type `TS6826` — the bill is saved as `TS6826` either way, on every
   line of that receipt. Blank / spaces-only is saved as "no invoice", same as before.

So from now on every new bill is stored in one consistent form, which also makes the
Verify Bill list group them together properly.

**Not changed:** bills received **before** this fix keep whatever casing/spacing they
were saved with — there is **no** clean-up of old records. That is exactly why matching
stays case- and space-tolerant: it is what still finds those older bills. Admin-only
path; nothing changes for any customer app.

**Regression checks:**

✅ Receive `TS6826 / ACME`, then try to receive `ts6826 / ACME` again → same
   *"already received"* 409 toast you'd get for an exact-case repeat; nothing is written.
✅ Receive with the invoice pasted as `  ts6826  ` → saved bill reads **`TS6826`**
   (no spaces, all caps) on **every** line of that receipt.
✅ Receive with a clean `TS6826` → still reads `TS6826` (nothing mangled).
✅ **Verify Bill** / lookup panel: search `ts6826` → the `TS6826` bill is found.
✅ Search `TS6826` (exact case) → still works exactly as before.
✅ An **older** bill saved as `ts6826` (before this fix) is still findable by searching
   `TS6826` or `ts6826`, and still shows on screen with its original casing.
❌ Search `TS6826` when only `TS6826-A` exists → **no** match (whole-number match, so a
   short number can't silently swallow a longer, genuinely different bill).

**Backend tests:** `packages/admin/__tests__/procurement-invoice-case.test.js` — 9 tests:
different-case dedupe 409, padded-vs-clean dedupe 409, different-case lookup, exact-case
lookup regression, whole-number (non-substring) matching, and four storage tests
(trim+uppercase, lowercase uppercased, already-clean unchanged on every line of the
receipt, spaces-only saved as no-invoice).

> **Link rule (for transfers later):** the warehouse **SKU** must equal the **barcode**
> of the store item you'll transfer to. Keep `PB001` handy.

### 3b. Verify Bill — browsable bill list (2026-08-05 rework)

A top-level page for browsing every bill received into a warehouse — a super admin
usually does NOT already know an invoice number, they pick a supplier and want to see
what came in. Was a single exact-invoice-number lookup form until this rework
(2026-08-05); now a live, paginated, searchable list. List endpoint: `GET
/admin/procurement/receipt/list?supplierId=&q=&page=&limit=&view=` (per-receipt totals
only, no line items — `view` picks one row per invoice+supplier or one row per
receive-click, see **View toggle** below). Per-row line detail (SKU/batch/qty/mrp) still
comes from the same `GET /admin/procurement/receive/lookup` endpoint §3a's in-modal
panel uses, fetched on demand the first time a row is expanded (cached per row after
that — the cache is dropped whenever a filter changes, including the View toggle, since
the very same row can have a different answer under the other view). Both endpoints
gated on `WAREHOUSE.RECEIVE_GOODS`.

- **Sidebar** → **Inventory & Warehouse** → **Verify Bill** (sits right below
  **Receive Goods**). Route: `/warehouse/verify-bill` (unchanged).
- **Filter bar**: **Warehouse** (required — a warehouse-role admin's own warehouse is
  auto-selected since the backend already scopes `GET /admin/warehouse` to what their
  role can see), **Supplier** (optional, defaults to **— Any supplier —** — picking one
  also hides the redundant Supplier column in the table below), **Search** (free text
  over invoice number, debounced 350ms, live-filters as you type — no Search button
  anymore).
- **Table** (20 bills/page, most recently received at the top — in **Aggregated** a bill
  counts as "recent" by its *latest* receive-action, so a Monday bill topped up on Friday
  sorts by Friday while still showing Monday's date): Invoice # (mono) · Supplier (hidden
  when a supplier filter is active) · Received · Items (line count) · Units (total qty)
  · Bill (**📎 View**, only shown when a bill was attached) · a chevron. Click **anywhere
  on the row** (or the chevron button) to expand an accordion below it with the SKU /
  Batch / Qty / MRP table + a **Change supplier** button — the same detail content the
  old exact-lookup cards used to show. Only one row is expanded at a time; expanding a
  second collapses the first. **Exception:** an **Aggregated** row that really does
  combine 2+ receive-events shows a short "this invoice combines N separate
  receive-events — switch to Individual" panel *instead of* the line table and the
  **Change supplier** button (see **View toggle** below for why).
- **📎 View** opens a modal previewing the attached bill: images render inline, PDFs
  render inline via `<embed>`, and anything else (Word/Excel/unknown extension) shows a
  "can't preview this" card with the parsed filename + an **Open / Download** button
  instead of a broken embed. An **Open in new tab** link is always available alongside
  the inline preview too.
- **Pagination**: *"Showing X–Y of Z bills"* + **‹ Prev** / **Next ›** (disabled at the
  boundary) + a **Page [ n ] of N** jump box you can type into (Enter or blur to jump;
  out-of-range numbers clamp to the nearest valid page). Typing in Search or changing
  page never clears the table first — a small "Updating…" indicator fades in where the
  table is while the *old* rows stay on screen (no flicker/flash-of-empty-state).

**Regression checks:**

✅ Pick a warehouse (or let it auto-select) → the list loads recent bills for that
   warehouse, paginated 20/page, with no need to already know an invoice number.
✅ Pick a **Supplier** → list filters to that supplier's bills only; the Supplier column
   disappears from the table (redundant once filtered).
✅ Type in **Search** (e.g. `INV-100` from §3a's regression check) → list live-filters by
   invoice-number substring after a short pause (~350ms) — no Enter / Search button
   needed.
✅ Click anywhere on a bill row → accordion expands below it with the SKU/Batch/Qty/MRP
   table (matches what **Receive goods** recorded) + a **N lines · N units total**
   footer. Click the same row (or its chevron) again → collapses. Expanding a
   **different** row collapses the first — only one open at a time. Re-expanding a row
   already opened this page load does **not** re-fetch (cached) — *unless* you changed
   the warehouse, supplier, search text or View in between, which collapses the open row
   and drops the cache so the next expand fetches fresh.
✅ Click **📎 View** on a bill with an **image** attachment → modal shows the image
   inline + an **Open in new tab** link.
✅ Click **📎 View** on a bill with a **PDF** attachment → modal shows it inline via
   `<embed>` + **Open in new tab**.
✅ Click **📎 View** on a bill with a **non-image/PDF** attachment (e.g. `.docx`,
   `.xlsx`, or no extension at all) → modal shows the parsed filename + *"This file type
   can't be previewed here."* + an **Open / Download** button (opens the file in a new
   tab) — no broken embed, no crash.
✅ A bill row with **no** attachment shows **—** in the Bill column (no View button).
✅ No bills match the current warehouse/supplier/search → muted line: *"No bills
   received in <warehouseName>[ from <supplierName>][ matching "<query>"] yet."* — the
   bracketed clauses only appear when that filter is actually active.
✅ On a warehouse with more than 20 bills: **Next ›** loads page 2 (**Prev** enables,
   **Next** disables at the last page); typing **2** into **Page [ ] of N** + Enter (or
   blurring the field) jumps straight to page 2.
✅ Change supplier from an expanded row (see below) → the accordion closes and the list
   **re-runs** so the changed row reflects the new supplier without a manual refresh.
✅ Warehouse-role admin (staff/manager) sees only their own warehouse in the dropdown and
   cannot browse another warehouse's bills (mirrors the same scoping as **Receive
   Goods** / **Warehouses**).

**Backend tests:** `packages/admin/__tests__/procurement-receive-lookup.test.js` — 8
tests covering dedupe 409, different-supplier ok, blank-invoice skip, lookup grouping +
mrp, lookup `exists:false`, lookup 400 on missing invoice, last with joined cost/expiry,
last `found:false`. *(`GET /admin/procurement/receipt/list` — the new list endpoint —
ships and is tested alongside the backend change that added it; see that change's own
test file.)*

**View toggle: Aggregated (default) vs Individual — which bill photo shows**

The filter bar has a **View** pair of buttons: **Aggregated** (default) merges every
receive-action that used the exact same invoice number + supplier into ONE row with the
totals summed; **Individual** is the old behaviour, one row per actual receive-click
(so one bill received over two days shows twice). Real example: bill `INV-77` received
Monday (10 items) and topped up Friday (4 more) → **Aggregated** shows one row,
14 items, dated Monday (the original receive), sitting near the top of the list because
it was *touched* Friday; **Individual** shows two rows.

**A genuinely merged row hides its correction controls (2026-08-09).** Expanding the
`INV-77` row in **Aggregated** does NOT show **Change supplier** — it shows
*"This invoice combines 2 separate receive-events…Switch to **Individual** view above to
see and correct each receipt separately."* Reason: **Change supplier** would rewrite
only ONE of the two events, splitting the bill across two suppliers (wrong COGS on a
live warehouse ledger) and un-merging the row on the next reload. In **Individual** the
same two rows expand normally, each with its own items and its own working
**Change supplier**.

**Merged rows now show a read-only item table too (hotfix, 2026-08-09).** Previously
expanding `INV-77` in Aggregated showed only the explanation text above, no item detail
at all. Now it also shows a table of every item across **all** the merged
receive-events, with columns **Product / Batch / Expiry / Received / Qty / Cost/pc /
MRP** (**Received** is which receive-event/day that line came from — e.g. Monday or
Friday). It's purely informational: no **Change supplier** button and no per-line
Edit/Correct pencil on this table. Switching to **Individual** is still how you correct
a specific receipt.

✅ `INV-77` (Monday + Friday) in **Aggregated** → expand → the "combines 2 separate
   receive-events" message, **no** Change supplier button.
✅ Expand a merged Aggregated row (invoice with 2+ receive-events) → item list from ALL
   events shows read-only (Product/Batch/Expiry/Received/Qty/Cost/MRP) — no
   Change-supplier or Edit buttons present.
✅ Switch to **Individual** → expand the Monday row → its 10 items **and** a working
   **Change supplier** (it targets exactly that one receive-action).
✅ A normal one-receive bill in **Aggregated** → expands to its item table + Change
   supplier as usual (the message is only for real merges, and a same-number bill from a
   *different* supplier, or the same number typed in a different case, does not count as
   a merge).
✅ Expand a row, then flip the View toggle **while it is still loading**, then expand the
   same invoice again → you get the correct panel for the view you are now in. (The
   half-finished lookup from the old view is discarded rather than being shown — before
   2026-08-09 it could land late and leave a merged row showing one event's items plus a
   live Change supplier button.)

On a merged row there can be several receive-actions but only one bill photo, because a
clerk usually uploads the photo once and doesn't re-scan it for a top-up. The rule
(backend, fixed 2026-08-09): the merged row shows the **earliest receive-action that
actually has a photo** — never a blank when a photo exists anywhere on that bill.

✅ Monday receive **with** a bill photo → Friday top-up **without** one → **Aggregated**
   row still shows **📎 View** with Monday's photo.
✅ Monday receive **without** a bill photo → Friday top-up **with** one → **Aggregated**
   row shows **📎 View** with Friday's photo (before the fix this row showed **—** and
   the only copy of the bill was unreachable from this page).
✅ Both receives have a photo → the **Monday** (original) one is shown, not Friday's
   re-scan.
✅ Neither receive has a photo → the Bill column shows **—** (no View button).
✅ Switch to **Individual** on any of the above → each row still shows **its own**
   receive-action's photo (the Friday-only-photo row shows 📎, the photo-less row shows
   **—**). This view is unchanged by the fix.

**Change supplier (2026-08-05):** each expanded row's accordion has a **"Change
supplier"** button (top-right of the detail panel, ghost style) so an auditor can fix a
receipt where the wrong supplier was picked. Gated on `WAREHOUSE.MANAGE` (same
permission as **Correct receipt** / write-off — super_admin, warehouse_manager; **not**
staff). Backend: `PATCH /admin/procurement/receipt/supplier` — updates every ledger row
of the invoice at once, recorded in the audit log.

✅ A **warehouse manager / super admin** sees **"Change supplier"** inside an expanded
   row → click opens a modal titled *"Change supplier — Invoice #<invoiceNumber>"*
   showing **Current supplier: <name>** (or **— none —**) and a **New supplier**
   dropdown (**— None —** first, then active suppliers, defaulted to the current
   supplier).
✅ Pick a **different** supplier → **Save change** → success toast (*"Supplier changed to
   <name>. N ledger row(s) updated."*) → the accordion closes and the list refreshes —
   the row now shows the new supplier name (or drops out of the list entirely if a
   Supplier filter was active and no longer matches).
✅ Re-open the modal and leave the **same** supplier selected → **Save change** is
   disabled with tooltip *"Pick a different supplier"*.
✅ Pick **— None —** and Save → success toast *"Supplier cleared. N ledger row(s)
   updated."* → the row shows **—** for supplier after the list refreshes.
❌ A **warehouse staff** admin never sees the **"Change supplier"** button in any
   expanded row (FE gate mirrors **Correct receipt**). Calling
   `PATCH /admin/procurement/receipt/supplier` directly as staff → **403** (backend
   safety net, independent of the FE gate).

**Line detail enrichment (2026-08-05):** the expanded accordion's line table gained
Product name/brand, a readable Expiry, and Cost/pc — a human verifying a bill against
the paper copy previously had only a barcode and a batch code to go on. `lookupReceipt`'s
`line` shape gained four nullable fields (`name`, `brand`, `costPrice`, `expiresAt` —
joined from `warehouse_stocks` / `stock_movements` / `warehouse_batches`); the same
enrichment also shows up in **Receive Goods**' dedupe-warning "Show items entered"
mini-table (Name, Cost/pc, Expiry added there too — Brand omitted to keep it compact).

✅ Receive a fresh bill (cost + expiry filled in) → **Verify Bill** → expand that row →
   the accordion table now shows **Product** (bold name, brand pill if the item has one,
   barcode underneath in small mono) / **Batch** / **Expiry** / **Qty** / **Cost/pc (₹)**
   / **MRP (₹)**, plus **Total cost (billed): ₹X,XXX.XX** and **Total MRP: ₹X,XXX.XX**
   under the line count in the footer.
✅ An old receipt entered before this change (or any receipt on a legacy/pre-enrichment
   warehouse) → an info banner *"Older receipt — product name, cost, and expiry weren't
   captured on the ledger at the time. Only SKU / Batch / Qty / MRP are available."*
   appears above the table; Product shows **— Unknown product —** + the barcode, Expiry
   shows **—**, Cost/pc shows **—** on every line.
✅ A line whose batch is an auto-named `AUTO-EXP-<expiry>` or `AUTO-RCV-<today>` code
   (blank batch no. left on the goods-receipt form) renders as **Auto (exp)** / **Auto
   (recv)** in the Batch column — hover it to see the full raw code as a tooltip.
   Supplier-typed batches (e.g. `LOT-A`) render exactly as entered, unchanged.
✅ A line whose expiry is already in the past → a red **expired** badge next to the date.
   A line expiring within 30 days → an amber **soon** badge. Anything further out (or no
   expiry) → no badge.
✅ Open **Receive Goods** for a supplier/invoice pair that already has a receipt → the
   dedupe-warning banner's **"Show items entered ▾"** mini-table now includes **Name**
   (between SKU and Batch), **Expiry**, and **Cost/pc (₹)** columns alongside the
   existing SKU/Batch/Qty/MRP.

### 3c. Admin top-bar search coverage  (2026-08-05)

The admin top-bar global search (Ctrl-K / ⌘-K on desktop, powered by `MenuSearch.tsx` and
`useMenu.ts` in haper-admin) now covers real-world admin terms across all roles and can
deep-link into specific **App Config** sections.

**Widened search keywords on 12 existing sidebar items:** typing `write off` now surfaces
**Items**; `change supplier` surfaces **Verify Bill**; `delivery radius` surfaces **Stores**;
`reorder policy` and `correct receipt` surface **Warehouses**. Dashboard, New Sale, Order Activity,
Item Lookup, Stock Health, App Config, Pickers, and Team pages got fresh synonym keywords too —
so admins find what they need without remembering exact sidebar labels.

**4 new deep-link anchors under `/config`:** selecting **force-update**, **support-contact**,
**not-serviceable-message**, or **store-controls** from search navigates to `/config#<anchor>`,
auto-scrolls the matching card into view, and briefly outlines it (~1.5s; respects
`prefers-reduced-motion`). Permissions: anchors inherit the parent `/config` permission gate
— non-super-admin roles (store admin, warehouse staff) that can't see `/config` won't see
these anchors in search either.

**Regression checks:**

✅ Open admin → **Ctrl-K** (or **⌘-K** macOS) → type `write off` → **Items** page appears in
   results. Click → lands on Items.
✅ Type each of: `change supplier`, `delivery radius`, `reorder policy`, `correct receipt`,
   `batch tracking`, `partial pick`, `mrp`, `dead stock`, `picker workflow` → each surfaces at
   least one relevant page (Verify Bill, Stores, Warehouses, Warehouses, Warehouses, etc.).
✅ Type `force update` → a card labeled **"force-update — App Config"** appears (marked "Section"
   in the sublabel). Click → navigates to `/config#force-update`, scrolls to that card, and
   highlights it with a border/shadow for ~1.5s.
✅ Repeat for `support contact` / `not serviceable message` / `store controls` → each shows as
   **"<Section> — App Config"** and scrolls + highlights on click.
✅ While already on `/config` → type `force update` → click the result → scroll + highlight still
   fires (already on the page, but link works).

**Logged in as store admin (non-super):**
✅ Type `force update` / `support contact` / `not serviceable` / `store controls` → **none**
   appear (store admin lacks `/config` permission).
✅ Type `delivery radius` → **no results** (Stores is super-admin-only).

**Logged in as warehouse manager / staff:**
✅ Type `write off` / `batch tracking` / `correct receipt` / `reorder policy` → each returns a
   warehouse-visible page (Warehouses, Stock Health, Item Lookup).
✅ Type `store admin` / `banner` / `promotion` → **no results** (super-admin pages only).

**Deploy:** admin-only frontend change; no backend work. Ships with the next admin deploy.

---

## 4. Build the shared catalogue  *(super admin)*

Categories, sub-categories and products are now **one shared list for the whole
company** — not per store.

### 4a. Categories + sub-categories  (CH-1)
1. Sidebar → **Categories**.
2. **+ Add Category** → name (e.g. `Grocery`), icon → Save.
   ✅ It's a **single create** — there is **no "store / add-to-all-stores" picker**
   (categories are global now).
3. **+ Add Sub-Category** → name (e.g. `Spreads`), pick **parent category** `Grocery`
   → Save.
4. ✅ As super admin you can **Rename / Delete / activate** categories & sub-categories.
✅ Each category row shows a per-store **item count** (0 for now — nothing stocked yet).

### 4b. Product Master  (CH-6)
1. Sidebar → **Product Master** → **+ New product**.
2. Fill: **Name** (`Peanut Butter 500g`), **Unit** (`unit(s)`), brand, **Category** =
   `Grocery`, **Sub-category** = `Spreads`, GST, barcode = `PB001`, and an **image**
   (B2 — **Upload image** from your device, or paste a URL) → Create.
   ✅ It appears in the product list with a generated product id (`iId`).
3. (Fan-out check) Edit the product's name/brand and Save → ✅ toast "synced N store
   item(s)" (N = how many stores already carry it; 0 right now).

> Products may already exist on dev (migrated from existing items). Either create a
> fresh one as above, or just use an existing product for the next steps.

#### 4b-i. Delete a product  *(super admin only)*

Real example: you typed a product twice by mistake (`Peanut Butter 500g` and
`Peanut Buttr 500g`). Nobody ever ordered or stocked the typo one, so it can be
deleted outright instead of sitting in the catalogue as "discontinued" forever.

`DELETE /admin/product/:productId` — removes the product **plus** its copy in every
store and its warehouse stock rows. Irreversible.

1. Sidebar → **Product Master** → find the throwaway product → **Delete** (red, last
   button in the Actions column).
2. ✅ A red **"Delete this product?"** confirm dialog opens first — nothing is sent
   until you press **Delete product**. **Cancel** / **Esc** / clicking the overlay
   closes it with no API call.
3. ✅ Confirm → success toast with the backend count
   (*"Product and 3 item(s), 1 warehouse row(s) deleted"*) and the list refreshes —
   the row is gone.

Edge cases:
- ❌ Product that was **ordered before** → blocked (409 `HAS_HISTORY`), toast:
  *"This product has order history and can't be deleted — use Discontinue instead."*
  ✅ The row **stays** in the list (nothing was deleted).
- ❌ Product with **warehouse stock movement history** → *"This product has warehouse
  stock history and can't be deleted — use Discontinue instead."*
- ❌ Product **sitting in a customer's cart** → *"This product is in a customer's cart
  and can't be deleted right now — try again later."* Clear the cart / wait, retry.
- ❌ Row already deleted in another tab (404) → *"That product no longer exists —
  refreshing the list."* and the list reloads.
- ✅ **Not** visible to store admin / manager / **warehouse manager** — super admin
  only, same gate as Edit & Discontinue (warehouse manager still sees only Assign +
  Barcode; see step 15k).
- ✅ While the delete is in flight the row's other buttons (Edit / Barcode / Assign /
  Discontinue) are disabled, and the dialog can't be dismissed mid-write.

Needs: backend `DELETE /admin/product/:productId` deployed to dev + the admin build.

---

## 5. Create a store — serving warehouse is REQUIRED  *(super admin)*  (CH-7)

1. Sidebar → **Stores** → **+ Add New Store**.
2. Fill name/phone/email/address/map link/lat/long/GSTIN.
3. **Inventory supply → Serving warehouse** = your warehouse. **This is required.**
   - The **Owner** field is **optional** (leave it blank — see the note below).
   - **Region** is now just a fallback label.
4. Save.

✅ Saves with a serving warehouse chosen.
❌ Try to save with **no serving warehouse** → blocked in the form, and the **server also
   rejects it** (CH-7 enforcement, live on dev).

> **No chicken-and-egg:** a store does **not** need a store admin to be created, so
> always make the **store first**, then its admin (next step). The Owner field being
> optional is what breaks the old "store needs admin / admin needs store" loop.

---

## 6. Create the store's admin  *(super admin)*

1. Sidebar → **Store Admins** → **+ New** → name/email/password → **Assigned Store** =
   the store you just made → Create.
2. ✅ If **no stores existed yet**, the store dropdown is **disabled** with a hint
   ("create a store first") — confirming the correct order.
3. Log in as this store admin in a separate browser/profile for the per-store checks
   (steps 9, and the item per-store view in step 8).

---

## 7. Put products into the store (onboarding)  *(super admin)*  (CH-6)

A new store starts with **zero items**. You add them from the Product Master.

1. Sidebar → **Product Master** → find `Peanut Butter 500g` → **Assign**.
2. Choose **All stores** *or* **Pick stores** → select the new store. Set a **Price /
   Selling price / Low-stock qty** → **Assign**.
3. ✅ A result line shows **assigned / skipped / failed** (e.g. "Assigned 1, skipped 0").
4. Sidebar → **Items** (with the new store selected in the switcher) → ✅ the item
   appears at **quantity 0**, with the catalogue details copied from the master and the
   **Grocery → Spreads** category.
5. ✅ Re-run Assign for the same product/store → it's **skipped** (idempotent).

### 7b. (Alternative) Add a one-off item directly — All-Stores store picker  (B3)
Onboarding normally goes through **Assign** (above). To add a **brand-new single item**:
Sidebar → **Items** → **Add New Item** *(super admin)*.
- ✅ If you're in **All Stores** mode (no store in the top switcher), the form shows a
  **required store picker** — pick the target store. Saving **without** one shows
  "Pick a store to add this item to…" and is blocked (no `x-store-id` to target).
- ✅ With a store already selected in the switcher, there's no picker — it's added to
  that store. The new item also creates/links its **product master** behind the scenes.

---

## 8. Stock the store

You can add stock two ways — test both.

### 8a. Manual Stock-In / Adjust-down  *(super admin or store admin)*  (CH-2)
1. Sidebar → **Items** → the item → **Stock adjust**.
2. **Stock In (add):** enter a quantity (e.g. `20`); optionally a **Batch no.**,
   **Cost/unit** (super admin only) and **Expiry** → Save.
   ✅ Quantity rises (0 → 20); a toast shows the new total.
   ✅ **Blank "Batch no." on a batch-tracking store** auto-names the lot by shelf-life,
     exactly like warehouse goods-receipt (§3): with an **Expiry** → `AUTO-EXP-<expiry>`
     (same expiry merges, different expiry = its own lot); **no Expiry** →
     `AUTO-RCV-<today>`. It no longer piles into the shared `LEGACY` bucket. The code
     shows in the item's **Batches (lots)** and the `MANUAL_ADJUST` **Stock Ledger** row.
   ✅ **Flag-OFF store:** a blank batch just `$inc`s the quantity — **no** batch, **no**
     auto code (unchanged legacy behaviour).
3. **Adjust down (remove):** switch to *Adjust down*, enter a quantity, select a **Reason** (required dropdown: Damaged / Expired / Count correction / Other), and optionally add a **Note**.
   ✅ The **Reason** dropdown is required. The **Remove Stock** button stays disabled until a reason is selected.
   ✅ The **Note** field (optional) stores extra detail for audit (e.g. "eaten by rat", "damaged batch ABC123").
   ✅ Entering **more than current stock** disables the button with a warning. A normal
   reduction lowers the quantity. (If stock changed underneath you and the server
   rejects it, you get a clear **"exceeds available stock"** toast.) Adjust-down FEFO-
   decrements existing lots — it never creates an auto batch.
   ❌ **Quantity entered but Reason is blank** → **Remove Stock** button stays disabled.

### 8b. Bring stock from the warehouse (transfer)  *(super admin)*  (CH-3, CH-4)
First make the link: **Items → the item → set Barcode = `PB001`** (same as the warehouse SKU).
1. Store-switcher = the store. Sidebar → **Transfers** → **+ New transfer**.
2. **Source warehouse** = your warehouse → search the item → set **Qty** `30` → **Create transfer**.
   ✅ Status **CREATED**; no stock moved yet.
   ✅ Clear a line's **Qty** to blank and click **Create transfer** → blocked with an error naming the item (nothing saves; previously omitted silently).
   ✅ Type a non-whole number (e.g. `2.5`) into **Qty** → blocked with "must be a whole number" error.
   ✅ Next to **Qty**, a hint shows the warehouse's current available stock (e.g. "12 in stock"). Entering more turns it red ("exceeds available — 12 in stock") and blocks **Create transfer**. This **client-side warning** is best-effort; **Dispatch** enforces the real stock (unchanged). If the stock can't be fetched at that moment, the save is allowed through (fails open).
3. **Dispatch** the transfer.
   ✅ Warehouse **Available** drops by 30; **store item quantity is unchanged** (golden rule).
   ✅ Expand the transfer → each line shows **Batches (shipped)** (the lots that went out) (CH-3).
4. **Receive** the transfer. The receive modal now has a **"Scan barcode"** box per line —
   you **must scan / type a barcode that matches the line's SKU** for every item that
   arrived. **"Confirm receipt" stays disabled** until each arrived line shows **✓ match**;
   a wrong code shows **✗ mismatch**. (The SKU **is** the barcode, so this is the same value
   from the warehouse receipt / transfer.)
   ✅ Scan `PB001` → line shows **✓ match** → **Confirm receipt** enables → store item rises
      by 30; the lot's real cost + expiry flow into the store.
   ❌ Scan a **wrong** barcode (e.g. `PB999`) → **✗ mismatch**, button stays disabled. If you
      force it via the API, the backend rejects with **400** `Barcode mismatch …` and **no
      stock moves** (transfer stays DISPATCHED).
5. **Stock Ledger** → a `TRANSFER_OUT` (warehouse, −30) and `TRANSFER_IN` (store, +30),
   both with the **Batch** column populated.

### 8c. Short receive → shrinkage (partial receive)  (CH-3, CH-4)
On **Receive**, each line has an editable **Received** qty. Enter **less** than dispatched
(e.g. dispatched 30, receive **28**) → scan the matching **barcode** → **Receive**.
✅ A line received as **0** (nothing arrived) needs **no** barcode scan — it's skipped.
✅ Store rises by **28** only; warehouse already lost the full **30** at dispatch (in-transit clears).
✅ The **2 missing units are shrinkage** — NOT returned to the warehouse and NOT added to the
   store; reconcile them at the next physical stock-take.
✅ Transfer closes as **RECEIVED** with the line showing `dispatched 30 / received 28`
   (highlighted yellow in the Transfers list). The linked request is marked **FULFILLED**.
✅ The shortfall shows up in the **Transfer Discrepancies** report (§12b).

---

## 9. Per-store category On/Off  *(store admin)*  (CH-1)

Log in as the **store admin** from step 6.

1. Sidebar → **Categories**.
   ✅ **No** Create / Edit / Delete buttons (head office owns the catalogue).
   ✅ Each category shows an **On / Off** switch + a short hint + the store's item count.
2. Turn `Grocery` **Off** → ✅ customers of this store stop seeing it (and its items).
   Turn it back **On** → it reappears. The category itself is never deleted.
   - ✅ The switch shows its **saved** state on reload (CH-1 `enabledForStore`, live on dev).

---

## 10. Replenishment — request → approve → fulfil → receive  (CH-4)

**Request  *(store admin)*:**
1. Store-switcher = the store. Sidebar → **Replenishment** → **+ Request stock** →
   search the item → **Requested qty** `40` → **Raise request**. ✅ Status **PENDING**.
   ✅ Click the request's **Items** cell (▸) to expand it: the per-line table now shows
   **Wh avail** and **Free** (= warehouse available − reserved) for each requested item —
   same numbers as the Approve modal, fetched once when the row is first opened. A line
   whose **Free** can't cover the requested qty shows **Free in red** (0 also red).
   Requests with no serving warehouse yet, or a SKU not stocked, show **"—"**.

**Approve  *(super admin / warehouse)*:**
2. Open the request → **Approve**. The modal shows per line: **Avail**, **Reserved**,
   and **Free** (= Avail − Reserved).
   ❌ Set an approve qty **above Free** → the server **rejects it** with a clear message
   and the modal stays open (CH-4).
   ✅ Approve **within Free** → status **APPROVED**; back on **Warehouses → stock** the
   item's **Reserved** rises by the approved qty and **Free-to-promise** drops.
3. **Fulfil → transfer** → a linked transfer (CREATED) is created.

**Move it:**
4. Sidebar → **Transfers** → that transfer → **Dispatch** (warehouse Reserved →
   **In-transit**) → **Receive** (In-transit → store stock).
   ✅ The request flips to **FULFILLED**; store quantity rises.

✅ **Status legends:** on Replenishment / Transfers / Warehouse stock, open the
   collapsible **"What do these mean?"** — every status (PENDING/APPROVED/…/**EXPIRED**,
   CREATED/DISPATCHED/RECEIVED/CANCELLED, Available/Reserved/In-transit, batch
   AVAILABLE/HOLD/RECALL) has a plain-English explanation.

> **EXPIRED (CH-4):** if an approved request isn't shipped within the window, a nightly
> job auto-releases the reservation and marks it **EXPIRED** (re-raisable). To see it
> without waiting, ask dev to run the `inventory-reservation-expiry` cron manually.

---

## 11. Batch Recall  *(super admin / warehouse)*  (CH-3)

1. Sidebar → **Batch Recall** → type the batch no. from step 3 (e.g. `LOT-A`) → **Trace**.
   ✅ It lists every **warehouse** and **store** holding that lot, with quantities + status.
2. With warehouse-manage rights, each row has **Hold / Recall / Release** buttons → set
   one to **Recall** → ✅ its status pill turns red; the lot is blocked from sale/dispatch.
   A legend explains AVAILABLE / HOLD / RECALL.
   - (Real cross-location results require **batch tracking on** for that warehouse/store
     — flip it from the Warehouse form / Store modal, step 1c / Prerequisites.)

---

## 12. Reports  *(super admin)*  (CH-5)

After a few **sales** exist in the store (place test orders, or use POS → New Sale):

1. Sidebar → **Profits**.
   ✅ The **margin %** is computed over **cost-known revenue** (it no longer shows a fake
   0% for items whose cost is unknown). When some revenue has no known cost, you see
   **"₹X revenue has unknown cost — excluded from margin"**.
2. Sidebar → **Product COGS**.
   ✅ A per-product table: units, revenue, **COGS**, gross profit, **margin %**, and
   **cost-unknown units** (highlighted). With a store selected → that store; switch to
   **All Stores** → the same product is **merged across stores**.
   ✅ Every row now also carries the product **thumbnail** (`image` in the API response) —
   in both single-store and **All Stores** mode. Same rule as Most Sold: for a product
   present in several stores the image comes from the **oldest store row**, so it doesn't
   flip between refreshes.
   ✅ A sold product whose item row was deleted (or that never had an image) still shows
   its numbers; `image` is simply **null** — the key is always present, never missing.
3. Sidebar → **Most Sold** → in **All Stores** mode there's a **"Merge same product
   across stores"** toggle.
   ✅ In **All Stores** mode every row shows the product **thumbnail** and its **selling
   price** — same as when a single store is selected. (Before this fix both were always
   blank in All Stores mode: the cross-store branch of the query never looked the item up.)
   ✅ For a product that exists in more than one store (same `iId`), the image/price shown
   is the **oldest store row's** — deterministic, it does not change between refreshes.
   ✅ A product whose item row was deleted still shows its **name, units and revenue**;
   only the thumbnail/price are blank (never an error, never a missing row).
   ❌ Known gap (not fixed here): switching the **"Merge same product across stores"**
   toggle ON returns **400 Bad Request** — the API validator rejects the `crossStore`
   query param the page sends. All-Stores mode without the toggle already merges by
   `iId`, so the numbers are correct; only the toggle itself is broken.

### 12b. Transfer Discrepancies report — short receipts  *(super admin / warehouse manager / store admin)*
Sidebar → **Inventory & Warehouse → Transfer Discrepancies**. Read-only; nothing is corrected here.
1. Do a **short receive** first (§8c) so there's data.
2. Open the report.
   ✅ One row per short line: **Transfer · Received date · Warehouse · Store · Item(SKU) ·
   Dispatched · Received · Short · Cost/unit · Loss ₹ · Dispatched by · Received by**.
   ✅ **Cost/unit** = the weighted-average of the dispatched lots; **Loss ₹** = short × cost.
   ✅ Top cards: **short lines**, **total units short**, **estimated loss value**.
   ✅ **From/To** date filter (on the received date) + **Export CSV**.
   ✅ A **fully-received** transfer does **not** appear (only shortfalls).
3. **Scope check:**
   - **Warehouse manager** → only their warehouse's short receipts.
   - **Store admin** → only their store's.
   - **Super admin** → all stores + warehouses (Warehouse/Store columns tell them apart).

---

## 13. Role-separation checks

**Store admin** should see:
- ✅ Categories with **On/Off only** (no CRUD); **no** Product Master / Warehouses /
  Suppliers / Store Admins / Profits / Product COGS in the sidebar.
- ✅ Items: can edit price/stock/barcode/location; catalogue fields (name/brand/category/
  GST/…) are **read-only/greyed** with an explainer (CH-6).
- ✅ Transfers: only **Receive**; Replenishment: **Request** + **Cancel** (no Approve/Fulfil).

**Super admin** should see all of the above as editable; editing a product's catalogue
fields warns it **updates every store**.

**Warehouse manager** should see (no store switcher): **Dashboard** (warehouse cockpit),
**Stock Health**, **Item Lookup**, **Warehouses** (stock + write-off + reorder policy),
**Suppliers**, **Transfers** (create/dispatch/cancel), **Replenishment** (approve/reject/fulfil),
**Stock Ledger**, **Batch Recall**, plus **Product Master** (create + assign to their served
stores — no edit/discontinue) and **Warehouse Staff** (their own warehouse's staff) — see §15k —
and **nothing else** store-side (no Items/Categories/Orders/Analytics/Stores). **Warehouse staff**:
the same minus the manage-only actions —
they can **view** warehouses/stock + **receive** + do transfers, but get **no** warehouse
CRUD, **no** Approve/Reject/Fulfil, **no** write-off, and Batch Recall is **trace-only** (full §15).

## 14. Negative / edge cases to confirm

- **Store create with no serving warehouse** → blocked (CH-7).
- **Approve beyond free-to-promise** → server 400, modal stays open (CH-4).
- **Adjust-down beyond stock** → button disabled / "exceeds available stock" (CH-2).
- **Insufficient warehouse stock on Dispatch** → 400, warehouse stock untouched.
- **Cancel a dispatched transfer** → warehouse stock returned; In-transit cleared; status CANCELLED.
- **Transfer line with no barcode** → rejected ("enroll a barcode first").
- **Edit a category as a store admin** → no edit controls (only On/Off).
- **Edit catalogue fields on an item as a store admin** → read-only (CH-6).
- **Warehouse write-off above on-hand** → 400, stock untouched (#3).
- **Stock Health / Item Lookup into a non-served store** → 403 (scoped to served stores).
- **Goods-receipt line with ₹0 / blank cost** → **blocked** (mandatory, FE toast + backend 400).
- **Goods-receipt line with a past expiry** → warning before save (#11).
- **Warehouse staff** opening New/Edit/Delete warehouse, Approve/Reject/Fulfil, or Write-off →
  the buttons aren't shown (permission-gated, not just role) (#9).
- **Turn on batch tracking on a warehouse/store that already has stock** (B1) → it **seeds the
  existing stock into lots** and the **next sale/dispatch still works** (no "insufficient
  quantity"); re-saving with it already on is a no-op (idempotent).

---

## 15. Warehouse-manager cockpit (new this round)

> Needs the latest **`feat/inventory-v2`** (backend) + **`feat/inventory-v2-admin`** (admin)
> deployed on dev. Seed a warehouse manager via the **Warehouse Staff** page (§1b) or the DB
> fallback (last appendix), assign them the warehouse from §1, and log in as them in a separate
> browser/profile. They have **no store switcher** (a warehouse isn't tied to one store) — their
> screens are scoped to **their warehouse + the stores it serves**.

### 15a. Warehouse home  (#1)
On login a warehouse role lands on a **Warehouse dashboard** (not the store sales "cockpit").
✅ Real counts from their own data: **requests waiting** to approve, **transfers to dispatch**,
**in-transit**, **low-stock + expiring** lots, **recent receipts** — with quick links. The top
strip reads **WAREHOUSE · &lt;their warehouse name&gt;**. (Before: warehouse roles saw a mock
"Store Admin" sales dashboard with fake numbers.)

### 15b. Create a push transfer — target-store picker  (#2)
Sidebar → **Transfers** → **+ New transfer**.
✅ A **Target store** dropdown lists the stores this warehouse serves; pick one → the item search
is **scoped to that store** → set qty → **Create transfer** → Dispatch as usual. (Before, a
warehouse manager couldn't create a transfer at all — there was no store to target.)
✅ The **Transfers list** and the printed **pick slip** now show the destination **store name**
(and warehouse name), not just an id (#4).
> ⚠️ **Known pending:** that in-modal item search still calls the store catalog endpoint
> (`items.view`), so a **pure warehouse manager may get a 403** there until it's repointed at the
> Item-Lookup endpoint (§15f). Super admin works today; the fix is a small follow-up.

### 15c. Write off / adjust warehouse stock  (#3)  *(manager only)*
Warehouses → select the warehouse → click a stock row → **Write off / adjust** → qty + reason
(**Damage / Expiry / Count correction / Other**).
✅ On-hand drops; a **ledger row** is written (DAMAGE, or MANUAL_ADJUST for a count); on a
batch-enabled warehouse it consumes the **soonest-expiry lot first**.
❌ More than on-hand → 400, untouched. ❌ Warehouse **staff** don't see the action (needs manage).

### 15d. Editable reorder policy  (#5)
Same stock detail → set **low / max / reorder** → Save. Drives the Low-stock filter,
auto-replenishment, and the Stock-Health buckets.

### 15e. Stock Health  *(sidebar → Stock Health)*
✅ **My warehouse stock (SKUs)** summary + **Stores I supply — overall**, then **By store** and
**By category → sub-category**, bucketed **Out / Low / Expiring / Expired / Overstock / Healthy**.
✅ Click a store row → its **at-risk items** (worst first) with barcode, qty, low/max, expiry.
> **Overstock** only flags items with a **real max** (`maxStock > 0`). If items have no max
> (0/blank), Overstock = 0 and they count as **Healthy** — that's correct, not "all overstocked".
Super admin sees the same with a **warehouse picker**.

### 15f. Item Lookup  *(sidebar → Item Lookup)*  — search / filter / details
A read-only catalogue browser over the served stores.
✅ **Search** by name or barcode; **filter** by **store**, **category**, and **sub-category** (the
dropdowns list every category/sub-category present, with item counts).
✅ Click a row → full detail: **Common** (name, brand, category, unit, weight, GST, product id) +
**per-store** (store, barcode, on-hand, low/max, price, selling, avg cost, location, status, expiry)
+ **Batches** (batch no, qty left, cost, expiry, status).
❌ A store the warehouse doesn't serve never appears (server **403** if forced).

### 15g. Reject a request with a reason  (#6)
Replenishment → a PENDING request → **Reject** → you're prompted for a **reason** (and an approve
note on a partial approval); the requesting store sees that warehouse note on the request.

### 15h. Goods-receipt: mandatory cost + expiry warning  (#10/#11)
On **Receive goods**, **Cost / unit (₹) is required and must be > 0** — a blank/₹0 line is
**blocked** (FE toast + backend 400), because that cost becomes the store's cost price
(weighted-average) on transfer. A **past-dated expiry** still shows a warning before save
(already-expired stock) but does not block.

### 15i. Staff vs manager  (#8/#9)
- **Warehouse staff** can now **view Warehouses + stock** and **Receive goods** (previously a 403
  blocked the whole flow) and do transfers — but get **no** warehouse CRUD, **no**
  Approve/Reject/Fulfil, **no** Write-off (buttons hidden, gated by permission), Batch Recall
  **trace-only**.
- **Warehouse manager** has the full set above.

### 15j. Warehouse manager sees ALL their options (permission floor + discoverability)
The manager's capabilities now come from the **role**, not a snapshot saved when the
account was created — so an older account that pre-dates a permission (e.g.
`warehouse.receive_goods`) gets it automatically on next login, **no DB change**
(backend `resolveEffectivePermissions`, haper-backend #98).

After deploying the latest dev backend **and** admin, **fully log out and log back in** as
the warehouse manager (a plain reload can keep a stale permission cache), then check:
- ✅ Sidebar shows: **Stock Health, Item Lookup, Replenishment, Transfers, Stock Ledger,
  Batch Recall, Receive Goods, Warehouses, Suppliers**.
- ✅ Dashboard shows a **"Receive goods from supplier"** hero button + a **Receive goods**
  chip in *Jump to*.
- ✅ Sidebar → **Receive Goods** (new item, route `/receive-goods`) → opens the warehouse
  stock view with the warehouse auto-selected and the goods-receipt form already open.
  Only **Receive Goods** highlights in the sidebar (not Warehouses too).
- ❌ If any are missing → stale session or stale admin build (see Troubleshooting).

### 15k. Warehouse manager: Product Master + Warehouse Staff  (CH-11)
A warehouse manager can now catalogue the goods they receive and staff their own warehouse —
without a super admin. Log in as a **warehouse manager** (no store switcher).

**Product Master (create + assign to served stores):**
- ✅ Sidebar → **Product Master** is now visible. Open it → the list loads.
- ✅ **+ New product** works — create a product (name/unit/barcode/image). Use this to catalogue a
  barcode you received into the warehouse but that isn't a product yet (the "orphan barcode" case).
- ✅ On a product row, **Assign** is shown; **Edit** and **Discontinue/Activate** are **hidden**
  (those fan out to every store — super-admin only; the backend also 403s them).
- ✅ In **Assign**, the store list shows **only the stores this warehouse serves** (fetched from
  `GET /admin/warehouse/:id/stores`). The segmented button reads **"All my stores"** (not "All stores").
  - ❌ There's no way to pick a store the warehouse doesn't serve; if forced via the API, the backend
    returns **403** "You can only assign products to stores your warehouse serves."
  - ✅ **"All my stores"** assigns to exactly the served stores (a store served by another warehouse
    is NOT touched).
  - ✅ The manager still sets **price / selling price / low-qty** at assign (same as the super-admin flow).
- ✅ Super admin is unchanged — sees Edit/Discontinue, and Assign "All stores" still means **every** store.

**Warehouse Staff (own warehouse, staff only):**
- ✅ Sidebar → **Warehouse Staff** is now visible. The list shows **only the STAFF of this manager's
  warehouse** (no managers, no other warehouse's staff).
- ✅ **+ New staff** → the **Role** field is locked to **Warehouse Staff** (no "Manager" option) and the
  **Warehouse** field is locked to the manager's own warehouse. Create works.
  - ❌ Forcing `role: warehouse_manager` via the API → **403** "A warehouse manager can only create
    warehouse staff, not a manager." Forcing another `warehouseId` → **403** "You can only add staff to
    your own warehouse."
- ✅ **Change password** + **Deactivate/Activate** work for the manager's own staff.
  - ❌ Editing/deactivating a staffer of **another** warehouse, or **any manager** → **403**.
  - ❌ A warehouse manager cannot change a staffer's raw **permissions** (super-admin only) → **403**.
- ✅ Super admin still manages **all** warehouse accounts (managers + staff, any warehouse) as before.

### 15l. Correct a PAST goods-receipt  *(manager / super admin)*
Fix a receipt you keyed wrong (qty up/down, expiry, batch code, cost) **without** faking a
write-off + re-receive, anchored on the batch lot `(warehouse, SKU, batch no.)`. The admin UI is
now built — a **Correct** button on each Batches-table row (batch warehouses) or **"Correct
receipt…"** in the write-off panel (legacy warehouses). The **2-decimal cost precision** fix shipped
with it.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause |
|---|---|
| Every warehouse/product call 404s | Backend `feat/inventory-v2` not deployed to the dev API |
| Category On/Off doesn't "stick" on reload | dev box is a build behind — pull/redeploy latest `feat/inventory-v2` (CH-1 `enabledForStore` is live there) |
| Store saves even with no serving warehouse | dev box is a build behind — pull/redeploy latest `feat/inventory-v2` (CH-7 enforcement; the form requires it regardless) |
| Batch Recall finds nothing / shows one "legacy" lot | Batch tracking **off** for that warehouse/store — turn it on (super admin) via the Warehouse form / Store modal checkbox (step 1c / Prerequisites) |
| "No serving warehouse" on Approve/Replenishment | Store's serving warehouse not set (step 5) |
| "…has no barcode/SKU" on transfer create | Store item missing a barcode = warehouse SKU (step 8b) |
| 403 on a warehouse/product-master action | Logged in as store admin (those are super/warehouse-only) |
| Store stock didn't change after Dispatch | Correct — store stock only rises on **Receive** |
| Warehouse manager sees a "Store Admin" sales dashboard | Admin not on latest `feat/inventory-v2-admin` (the #1 warehouse dashboard) |
| Stock Health shows **everything Overstock**, Healthy 0 | Backend not redeployed — fixed so Overstock needs `maxStock > 0` (§15e) |
| Stock Health / Item Lookup are empty | This warehouse serves **no stores** (no store's serving-warehouse = this one) |
| Item search 403s inside **New Transfer** (warehouse mgr) | Known pending — uses the `items.view` catalog endpoint (§15b); super admin works |
| Warehouse mgr missing Replenishment/Transfers/Recall/Receive Goods in sidebar; clicking *Jump to* bounces back | Admin build behind — `hasPermission()` used to deny **all** permission-gated UI for warehouse roles (only manager/support were checked). Fixed in admin `1969703`; deploy latest admin + hard refresh (⇧⌘R). Note role-gated items (Stock Health, Item Lookup, Warehouses, Suppliers) showed fine even while this bug was live |
| Order modal shows no "Order Activity" trail | Expected if that order had **no** edits/cancels/refunds/picker short-pick-OOS — it now shows a **"No activity recorded yet"** line. Do an item edit/cancel, or test a picker short-pick, to see rows (or open the **Order Activity** page) |
| Transfer Qty shows "exceeds available" hint / **Create transfer** blocked | Working as intended — the warehouse's stock is lower than the entered quantity; adjust the quantity or check **Stock Health** / **Item Lookup** for the real available count |

---

## Appendix — auto-replenishment (optional)

The system can **auto-draft** PENDING replenishment requests for low stock (hourly
`auto-replenishment` cron) for warehouse-enabled stores with a resolvable serving
warehouse; it only drafts — the warehouse still approves/fulfils. Items at/below
`lowQty` (with a barcode) get a `source = AUTO` request. To test: set an item's
`lowQty` above its quantity, ensure the store has a serving warehouse + the item has a
barcode, then wait for the hourly run (or ask dev to trigger the cron) → a PENDING
**AUTO** request appears under Replenishment. Re-running won't duplicate an open request.

## Appendix — seed a warehouse manager via DB (fallback)

Prefer the **Warehouse Staff** page (§1b). DB fallback (point at an existing warehouse `_id`):

```js
db.admins.updateOne(
  { email: "wh.manager@example.com" },
  { $set: {
      roles: ["warehouse_manager"],
      warehouseId: ObjectId("<WAREHOUSE_ID>"),
      permissions: [
        "warehouse.manage", "warehouse.manage_suppliers", "warehouse.receive_goods",
        "warehouse.manage_transfers", "warehouse.approve_replenishment", "warehouse.view_ledger"
      ],
      status: 1
  } },
  { upsert: false }
);
```

## 14. Shelf (location) uniqueness

A **real shelf code can hold only one item per store** — you can't assign the same
shelf to two different items. The `DefaultShelf1` placeholder (the migration's
"unassigned" value) and an empty shelf are **exempt**. Matched **case-insensitively**
(`A3` == `a3`). Enforced in admin item **create** + **edit**.

> **Also fires from the Items list now.** The **Shelf** column on `/items` is
> **click-to-edit** (type a code, press Enter) and it goes through the *same*
> `PUT /admin/item/:itemId`, so the same 409 message appears as an error toast and the
> cell reverts. Full walkthrough: **[`test-admin-ui.md` → Issue 11](./test-admin-ui.md)**.

Steps (admin):
- ✅ Give item A shelf `A3`, save. Give item B shelf `A3` → **blocked, 409**:
  *"Shelf "A3" is already assigned to "…". Each shelf can hold only one item."*
- ✅ Same with different case (`a3` on item B) → still blocked.
- ✅ Move item B to a **free** shelf (`B3`) → saves fine.
- ✅ Two items both on `DefaultShelf1` → allowed (placeholder is exempt).
- ✅ An item that **already** shares a shelf with another (legacy data) can still be
  **edited** as long as you don't change its shelf — only *moving onto an occupied
  shelf* is blocked.

Tests: `packages/admin/__tests__/item-shelf-unique.test.js` (5, green).

> **Follow-up (not done):** a **partial unique index** on `{ storeId, location }`
> (excluding `DefaultShelf1`/empty) would make this a hard DB guarantee, but it can't
> be built until the **6 existing duplicate shelves in prod** (`AH3, C1, E4, J4, ZP4,
> ZZ31`) are resolved. Re-shelve one item of each pair, then add the index via a
> migration. Until then the app-level check above is the guard.

## 16. Store → Warehouse RETURN (store sends stock back)  *(store admin + super admin + warehouse)*

**Phase C (admin FE) is now built.** On `/transfers` a **store admin or super admin**
sees a **"+ Return to warehouse"** button next to "+ New transfer" (store admin does not
see "+ New transfer" — that stays warehouse-role-only). Each row shows a **↩ Return /
→ Forward** direction badge, and a direction filter (`All directions` / `Warehouse to
store` / `Store returns`) sits next to the status filter. A `PENDING_APPROVAL` return
shows an **Approve** button to a super admin only; Dispatch/Cancel on a return act on
the SOURCE (the store), so they're visible only to the store admin who owns it or a
super admin — not to warehouse roles, who'd always get a 403 (their `req.store` is
null). The backend still re-checks every one of these on the actual call, the FE
gating is UX only. The
printed pick slip on a return reads "From store … / To warehouse …". **Needs an admin
deploy** for the UI; the backend behaviour below needs its own (already-shipped)
backend deploy.

**Click-by-click (store admin), matches 16a below:**
1. `/transfers` → **+ Return to warehouse** → pick a reason (Excess / Near expiry /
   Damaged / Wrong item / Other — Other requires a short free-text reason) → search the
   store's own items by name/barcode → add lines → **Create return**.
2. The new row appears with the ↩ Return badge, status **Created** (or **Pending
   approval** if over the 50-unit gate, see 16b) → **Dispatch**.
3. A warehouse manager/staff on the destination warehouse opens the same row →
   **Receive**, scans each line's barcode → warehouse stock rises.

Until/if you want to bypass the UI, everything below still works with an API client
(Postman / curl) against `dapi.haper.in` exactly as written.

Prerequisite: the store must have a **serving warehouse** set (Stores → the store →
*Serving warehouse*), and every item being returned must have a **barcode**.

### 16a. Happy path — a small return  *(store admin)*
`POST /admin/transfer/return` as a **store admin**:
```json
{ "items": [ { "storeItemId": "<24hex>", "quantity": 5 } ],
  "returnReason": { "code": "EXCESS" }, "note": "optional" }
```
✅ **200**, status **CREATED**, `direction: "STORE_TO_WAREHOUSE"`.
✅ `storeId` is **their own store** even though the body never said so, and `warehouseId`
   is the store's **serving warehouse** (the response also names it, `data.warehouseName`).
✅ No stock has moved yet.
1. `POST /admin/transfer/:id/dispatch` (**the store admin can now do this themselves**)
   → shelf drops by 5, ledger row `RETURN_OUT` (−5).
2. `POST /admin/transfer/:id/receive` as the **destination warehouse manager**, with the
   barcode scanned per line → warehouse **Available** rises by 5, ledger row `RETURN_IN` (+5).

Reason codes: `EXCESS` · `NEAR_EXPIRY` · `DAMAGED` · `WRONG_ITEM` · `OTHER`.
❌ `OTHER` **without** free text → **400**. `OTHER` with text → 200 and the text is stored.
❌ Free text on any **other** code → **400** (a coded reason carries no free text).
❌ No `returnReason` at all → **400**.

### 16b. Big returns need a super admin's approval  (>50 units)
The gate is on the **TOTAL units across all lines**, and it is **strictly greater than 50**.
It is also **cumulative per store over the last 24 hours** — see 16b-2.
- ✅ 50 units (or 25 + 25 on two lines) → **CREATED**, dispatch straight away.
- ✅ 51 units (or 26 + 26) → **PENDING_APPROVAL**, message *"awaiting super admin approval"*.
- ❌ Dispatching a `PENDING_APPROVAL` return → **400** *"cannot be dispatched from status
  PENDING_APPROVAL"*. Receive → 400. Edit items → 409.
- ✅ Super admin: `POST /admin/transfer/:id/approve` → status becomes **CREATED**, and
  `approvedAt` / `approvedBy` are stamped. Now the store admin can dispatch.
- ❌ The store admin who raised it **cannot** approve their own (403). Nor can the
  warehouse manager (403). **Super admin only.**
- ❌ Approving twice → **409**. Approving a *forward* transfer → **400** *"Only a store
  return requires approval"*.
- ✅ The approval **queue**: `GET /admin/transfer?status=PENDING_APPROVAL` (has a `total`).
- ✅ **Declining** a big return = **cancelling** it (there is no separate "reject" button).
  `cancelledBy` records who did it, so "the store withdrew it" and "a super admin
  declined it" are distinguishable.

### 16b-2. Splitting no longer gets around the approval  *(security fix, 2026-09-07)*
The 50 units are counted **across every open return this store raised in the last 24 hours**,
not just the one you are sending now. "Open" = `PENDING_APPROVAL`, `CREATED` or `DISPATCHED`.

Real example — Chapra store, same afternoon:
1. Return **30** units of Maggi → ✅ **CREATED** (30 ≤ 50, no approval).
2. Return **30** units of Atta → ✅ 200, but status **PENDING_APPROVAL**, and the message
   says *"…this store has already returned 30 units in the last 24h"*. 30 + 30 = 60 > 50.
3. The **first** return is **not** re-graded — a decision already taken stands.

- ✅ 20 then 30 = exactly 50 → still **CREATED**. One more unit → **PENDING_APPROVAL**.
- ✅ **Cancelled** and **RECEIVED** returns stop counting (nothing is in flight any more);
  a **DISPATCHED** one still counts (those units have left the shelf).
- ✅ The window **rolls**: an open return older than 24h drops out of the sum.
- ✅ Per **store** — Store B's returns never push Store A over the line. Forward transfers
  never count at all.
- ✅ A super admin raising the return *on behalf of* a store is graded on **that store's**
  history, not their own.

**Cap on open drafts.** A store may hold at most **10** returns that are
`PENDING_APPROVAL` + `CREATED` (not yet dispatched) at once.
- ❌ The 11th → **400** *"This store already has 10 open returns (limit 10). Dispatch or
  cancel an existing return before creating another."* — and **nothing is written**.
- ✅ Cancelling **or** dispatching one frees a slot. The cap is per store, and forward
  transfers do not use up slots.

### 16b-2b. Both gates also hold when requests arrive AT THE SAME TIME  *(security fix, 2026-09-07)*
Both checks used to be made **before** the return was saved, so requests fired together all
read the same "nothing open yet" picture and all slipped under the limit — the same bypass as
splitting, just done simultaneously instead of one after another. Each request now
**re-checks after saving** and corrects itself.

Real example — a store admin double-taps *Send return* (or a script fires four at once), 20
units each:
- ✅ All four are accepted (**200**), and every one of them comes back
  **PENDING_APPROVAL** — 4 × 20 = 80 > 50, so nobody gets to skip the sign-off.
- ✅ Sending **one** 20-unit return on a quiet store is still plain **CREATED**; the
  re-check never escalates a request that is genuinely under the limit.
- ✅ 13 returns fired together on an empty store → exactly **10** stay open and the surplus
  **3** get the same *"limit 10"* 400. Those 3 exist in the list as **CANCELLED** (they were
  saved, then immediately withdrawn) — that is expected, not a bug.
- ⚠️ Escalating is always the safe direction: under a true race a return may end up
  **PENDING_APPROVAL** that a slower, one-at-a-time run would have left **CREATED**. A super
  admin approving it is the fix; nothing is lost.
- ✅ **The surplus returns show `cancelledBy` empty, not the store admin** *(fix,
  2026-09-07)*: the store admin asked to *create* a return, not cancel one — the system
  withdrew it. Same signature as the 7-day auto-expiry (**16i**); a real admin id in that
  field always means a person decided.
- 🔎 **Why this needed a second fix to work on the real servers** *(2026-09-07)*: the
  re-check reads the return it just saved, but the live services read from a **replica**
  that can be a moment behind, so the re-check could read the *old* picture and let the
  race through anyway. Both re-check queries now read the **primary** explicitly. This
  cannot be seen on a laptop (the test database has no replica) — it is pinned by
  `transfer-return-secondary-read.test.js`, which runs a real 3-node set and fails without
  the fix. **Needs a backend deploy** to take effect.

### 16b-3. Editing an approved return re-arms the approval  *(security fix, 2026-09-07)*
Only a super admin / warehouse role can `PATCH /admin/transfer/:id/items` (a store admin
still gets 403 — see the matrix), but that edit used to skip the approval gate entirely.
- ✅ Approve a 60-unit return (it becomes **CREATED**), then edit its lines to **5000** →
  status flips **back to `PENDING_APPROVAL`** and `approvedAt` / `approvedBy` are **cleared**.
  It is not dispatchable again until somebody **approves it afresh**.
- ✅ Editing **down** to 50 or fewer → stays **CREATED**, the original approval is kept.
- ✅ A small return that never needed approval, edited up to 51 → **PENDING_APPROVAL**.
- ✅ A **forward** transfer is never re-graded (5000 units still just **CREATED**).
- ✅ **The edit is graded on the same 24h store total as a new return** *(fix, 2026-09-07)*:
  the store has one open **20**-unit return and somebody edits a second one up to **40** →
  **PENDING_APPROVAL**, because 20 + 40 = 60 > 50 — even though 40 on its own is under the
  line. Before this, several small returns could each be edited up to 50 with no sign-off.
  The edited return's **own** old quantity is swapped out, not counted twice (a lone 40-unit
  return edited to 45 stays **CREATED**), and an open return older than 24h does not count.

### 16b-4. The same item twice in one request is rejected  *(security fix, 2026-09-07)*
❌ `items: [ {A, 30}, {A, 30} ]` → **400** *"Each item can only appear once per transfer —
combine duplicate lines into a single quantity."*, nothing is written.
- Applies to **all three** writers: `POST /admin/transfer/return`, `POST /admin/transfer`
  (forward create) and `PATCH /admin/transfer/:id/items` (the existing lines stay intact).
- ✅ Two **different** items in one request are of course still fine.
- Why: receive matches each posted `receivedQty` to a line **by item id**, so a duplicated
  line let the same physical units be credited to the warehouse twice.

### 16c. Who can do what (the 403 matrix)
| Actor | Action | Result |

> ⚠️ **Why "even if granted the permission":** a `store_admin` passes **every** permission
> check in this system automatically. So these routes are guarded by **role**, not by
> permission. If you ever need to stop a store admin doing something here, it must be a
> role check — adding/removing a permission will do nothing.

### 16d. Nothing can go negative
- ❌ Return more than the shelf holds → **dispatch fails with 400 naming the item**, the
  shelf is **unchanged**, the transfer stays **CREATED**, and **no ledger rows** are written.
- ❌ Multi-line where only the last line is short → the **whole** dispatch is rolled back;
  the earlier lines are **not** decremented.
- ✅ Cancel **after** dispatch → the units go back on the shelf with their original cost +
  expiry, ledger row `MANUAL_ADJUST` / `return_cancelled_restock`.
- ❌ A **RECEIVED** return cannot be cancelled (400) — correct it with a fresh forward transfer.
- ✅ Partial receive → the warehouse rises by the received qty only.
- ❌ Receive with **no** scanned barcode, or a **mismatched** one → 400, zero stock moves.
- ✅ A return **never** touches the warehouse *reserved* / *in-transit* buckets.

### 16e. Store with no serving warehouse
❌ **400**: *"This store has no serving warehouse set — ask a super admin to set one before
returning stock."* There is **deliberately no guess-by-region fallback** here (unlike
replenishment): a wrong guess would physically ship cartons to the wrong warehouse.
❌ Serving warehouse **inactive** → 400 *"The store's serving warehouse is not active."*

### 16f. Nothing else changed  (regression checks)
- ✅ `POST /admin/transfer` (forward create) behaves exactly as before, including a super
  admin creating a return the old way with `direction: STORE_TO_WAREHOUSE`. That return is
  now **stamped `approvedBy` / `approvedAt` with the super admin who created it**
  *(fix, 2026-09-07)* — a super admin **is** the approver, so an audit can tell "signed off
  at creation" apart from "was too small to ever need approval" (both used to show an empty
  approver forever). A **forward** transfer created the same way still carries no approver.
- ✅ A warehouse manager creating a return via the old route is still refused (403).
- ✅ Old transfers with **no direction saved** still list, still dispatch as forward, and a
  store admin still cannot dispatch them.
- ✅ The **Transfer Discrepancies** screen looks exactly the same as before (it now asks
  the API for the forward direction explicitly — see 16h).
- ❌ **Barcode change is blocked while a return is waiting for approval** — changing a
  product's barcode while it sits on a `PENDING_APPROVAL` return returns **409**
  *"This product is on an open stock transfer…"*. Cancel or finish the return first.
  (This is the one non-obvious knock-on of the new status.) It now **un-blocks by itself**
  after 7 days — see 16i.
- ✅ `GET /admin/transfer/:id` for a transfer that is **not yours** now answers **404
  "Transfer not found"** — the same answer an id that does not exist gets (it used to say
  403, which quietly confirmed the id was real). Reading your **own** transfer is unchanged.
  No admin screen calls this endpoint today, so nothing visible changes.

### 16h. Short-received RETURNS now appear in the discrepancy report  *(security fix, 2026-09-07)*
`GET /admin/transfer/discrepancies` used to be hard-coded to forward transfers only, so a
return the warehouse received **short** was invisible: the store could dispatch 100 units,
the warehouse count 60, and nothing ever surfaced anywhere.
- ✅ With **no** `direction` in the query it now returns **both** directions, and every row
  carries its own `direction`.
- ✅ `?direction=STORE_TO_WAREHOUSE` → returns only. `?direction=WAREHOUSE_TO_STORE` →
  the original forward-only view (legacy transfers with no direction saved included).
- ❌ An unknown direction value → **400**.
- The **admin screen is unchanged on purpose**: it now sends
  `direction=WAREHOUSE_TO_STORE` explicitly, because its wording and columns ("the store
  received fewer units than the warehouse dispatched") only describe that side. The returns
  view comes with the rest of the return UI in Phase C. **Needs an admin deploy** (one-line
  FE change) — but the page behaves identically either way, so it is not urgent.

### 16i. A return nobody approves expires after 7 days  *(new cron job, 2026-09-07)*
A `PENDING_APPROVAL` return used to wait forever, and while it waited it kept **blocking
barcode changes** for its products and counting against the store's 24h budget and 10-draft cap.
- ✅ A new daily job (**3:50 AM IST**, `return-approval-expiry`) **cancels** any return still
  in `PENDING_APPROVAL` more than **7 days** after it was created.
- ✅ It touches **nothing else**: `CREATED` / `DISPATCHED` / `RECEIVED` / already-cancelled
  transfers are left alone however old they are.
- ✅ It moves **no stock** (a pending return holds none) and writes **no ledger rows**.
- ✅ `cancelledBy` is left **empty** — that is how you tell an auto-expiry apart from a store
  withdrawing its return or a super admin declining it (both stamp a real admin).
- ✅ Once it expires, the **barcode change goes through again**.
- **Needs a backend deploy** (the cron service).

### 16j. Creating a return no longer fails with "duplicate key ... TR0000xx"  *(hotfix, 2026-09-08)*
On dev, `POST /admin/transfer/return` failed with
`E11000 duplicate key error ... index: transferId_1 dup key: { transferId: "TR000005" }`.
Every transfer number (`TR000001`, `TR000002`, …) comes from a counter stored in its own
`sequences` record. That counter had fallen **behind** the transfers themselves (counter said
5, the newest transfer was already TR000045), which happens whenever transfers arrive in the
database without going through the app — a data restore/import, for example. The app then kept
handing out numbers that were already taken.
- ✅ Creating a return (and a forward transfer, and a transfer created from a replenishment
  request) now succeeds even if the counter is behind: the app notices the clash, jumps the
  counter past the highest existing number, and saves. In the dev case the next transfer is
  **TR000046**.
- ✅ The number is **never reused**: check the transfer list — no two transfers share a
  `TR…` number, and the counter only ever moves forward.
- ✅ Two people creating returns at the same second still get different numbers.
- ✅ Nothing else about the return changes (status, gates, stock, ledger are untouched).
- **Needs a backend deploy.** No database change and no manual counter fix — the first
  create after the deploy repairs the counter by itself.

### 16g. Known and ACCEPTED limits — do not report these as bugs
- ~~**Splitting gets around the 50-unit approval.**~~ **CLOSED 2026-09-07** — the gate is
  now cumulative per store over 24h, plus a 10-draft cap. See **16b-2**.
- **The gate counts UNITS, not money.** 51 sachets need approval; 50 tins of ghee do not.
  It is deliberately **not** a financial control.
- **A store admin still cannot edit a draft return** (403) — cancel it and create a new one.
  A super admin / warehouse role can, and that edit is now re-graded against the 50-unit
  gate (**16b-3**).
- **The 24h window is a supervision control, not a stock-safety one.** A determined store
  admin can still move a lot of stock over many days in 50-unit slices. Every return is
  still blocked from going negative and is physically counted at receive; catching a slow
  drain is the discrepancy report's and the stock-take's job, not this gate's.
- ~~**Two returns sent at the same instant both skip the gate.**~~ **CLOSED 2026-09-07** —
  both gates re-check after saving. See **16b-2b**. The cost of that safety: under a real
  race the extra returns are graded **PENDING_APPROVAL** (approve them), and a surplus over
  the 10-draft cap appears in the list as **CANCELLED**.
- **No notification** is sent to the warehouse when a return is created or dispatched —
  they see it in their Transfers list. Same as forward transfers today.

Tests: `packages/admin/__tests__/transfer-return-store-initiated.test.js` (107),
`transfer-return-backcompat.test.js` (11), `transfer-return-secondary-read.test.js` (1,
3-node replica set) and `packages/cron/__tests__/return-approval-expiry.test.js` (7) —
126, green.
